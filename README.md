1. Following a string With yellow hairs,
1. I am more lost than I ever was
1. And more found than I ever will be.
1. In the heart of an artichoke 
1. No more fingers or legs
1. No more hunger 
1. no more desire.
1. In the new world
1. Street lights are stars
1. fish drive the cars.
1. I digest it all In big swallows and heaves
1. Slipping into a carburetor rhythm
1. The toothbrush is a rolling hill, teeth a flock of geese.
1. Come with me to walk on the road of the future.
1. The road of the future is a slip n slide.
1. It is made of a tarp and smushed grapes. 
1. She is kneeling 
1. But soon to spring up 
1. With more of it than she can carry
1. And no one who wants it.
1. And her tune is a crushing, freezing sound
1. She sings it with ease as everyone covers their ears.
1. It is not new, but it is not known
1. How it embroiders the night 
1. And it is so sure to be there without fail, hated ignored, but still there
1. It will give you love if you let it.
1. It will give you love.
1. Lift it into your arms like a child
1. Sift it like sediments.
1. Let ugliness live in your world, your future landscape,
1. remember it fondly and it will sparkle onto you.

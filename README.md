Following a string With yellow hairs,
I am more lost than I ever was
And more found than I ever will be.
In the heart of an artichoke 
No more fingers or legs
No more hunger 
no more desire.
In the new world
Street lights are stars
fish drive the cars.
I digest it all In big swallows and heaves
Slipping into a carburetor rhythm
The toothbrush is a rolling hill, teeth a flock of geese.
Come with me to walk on the road of the future.
The road of the future is a slip n slide.
It is made of a tarp and smushed grapes. 
She is kneeling 
But soon to spring up 
With more of it than she can carry
And no one who wants it.
And her tune is a crushing, freezing sound
She sings it with ease as everyone covers their ears.
It is not new, but it is not known
How it embroiders the night 
And it is so sure to be there without fail, hated ignored, but still there
It will give you love if you let it.
It will give you love.
Lift it into your arms like a child
Sift it like sediments.
Let ugliness live in your world, your future landscape,
remember it fondly and it will sparkle onto you.
